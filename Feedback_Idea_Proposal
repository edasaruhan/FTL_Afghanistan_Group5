Your project idea is strong, with its dual focus on reducing food insecurity and waste through local redistribution and emergency assistance. This combination ensures the app is both practical and impactful. To make it unique, consider incorporating cultural and regional adaptability tailored to Afghanistanâ€™s specific needs. For example, you could include features that accommodate language preferences, cultural dietary restrictions, or offline access for users in remote areas with limited internet connectivity. Additionally, integrating real-time geolocation services could help identify nearby vendors and underserved areas more effectively, making the app even more dynamic and responsive to user needs. These enhancements would set your project apart and ensure it directly addresses the local context while remaining scalable
